# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `inspire/` is the main Python package.
- CLI entry point: `inspire/cli/main.py`; command groups in `inspire/cli/commands/`; formatters in `inspire/cli/formatters/`.
- Domain packages (preferred for shared logic; used by CLI):
  - `inspire/config/` config models, TOML/env loading, and schema/options.
  - `inspire/platform/openapi/` platform OpenAPI client + resource selection.
  - `inspire/platform/web/` web-session (SSO) + browser-only endpoints (`session/`, `browser_api/`).
  - `inspire/core/` small shared utilities (no CLI concerns).
  - `inspire/bridge/` bridge/tunnel/SSH integrations (in progress).
  - `inspire/features/` higher-level workflows (in progress).
- Legacy: backward-compat modules have been retired; current code is organized under `inspire/cli/`, `inspire/config/`, `inspire/platform/`, and `inspire/bridge/`.
- Command groups may be split across modules: `inspire/cli/commands/job.py`, `notebook.py`, `tunnel.py`, and `resources.py` are registries, with subcommands implemented in `<group>_*.py`.
- Internal-only implementations still use `_impl/` in some CLI areas (e.g. `inspire/cli/commands/_impl/`). Prefer moving reusable logic into `inspire/config/`, `inspire/platform/`, `inspire/bridge/`, and `inspire/features/` instead of adding new `_impl` modules.
- `tests/` contains pytest suites (for example, `tests/test_cli_commands.py` and `tests/test_cli_smoke.py`).
- `examples/` holds workflow YAMLs for Gitea Actions.
- `scripts/` contains exploration/automation utilities used during API and UI discovery (gitignored; internal-only by default).
- `docs/` and `README.md` document usage; `bin/inspire` is a repo-local wrapper.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `uv tool install -e .` installs the CLI in editable mode without activating a venv.
- `uv venv .venv && uv pip install -e .` creates a local venv and installs the package for development.
- `inspire --help` validates the entry point.
- `uv run pytest` runs the unit test suite.
- `uv run pytest -m integration` runs integration tests that require live API access.
- `uv run ruff check .` and `uv tool run black .` run linting and formatting.
- `uv` may update `uv.lock` during runs; avoid committing it unless you intentionally changed dependencies.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python 3.10+ codebase; follow Black and Ruff defaults with a 100-character line length.
- Use `snake_case` for functions/variables, `CapWords` for classes, and `test_*.py` for test files.
- CLI command groups map to `inspire/cli/commands/<group>.py` (for example, `job.py` for `inspire job ...`); subcommands may live in `inspire/cli/commands/<group>_*.py`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests live under `tests/` and use pytest.
- Integration tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`; keep them isolated from unit tests and avoid requiring live credentials in unit runs.
- `tests/test_cli_smoke.py` covers basic `--help` output; update it when adding/removing top-level command groups.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits use short, imperative, sentence-case subjects (for example, "Fix job logs --follow..."); follow this style and avoid verbose prefixes.
- PRs should include a concise summary, testing notes, and any configuration or environment changes; attach CLI output or screenshots when behavior changes are user-facing.

## Configuration & Security Tips
- Required environment variables include `INSPIRE_USERNAME`, `INSPIRE_PASSWORD`, and `INSPIRE_TARGET_DIR`; Gitea variables (`INSP_GITEA_REPO`, `INSP_GITEA_TOKEN`, `INSP_GITEA_SERVER`) are needed for sync/remote logs.
- Config files are loaded from `~/.config/inspire/config.toml` (global) and `./.inspire/config.toml` (project).
- Optional: `INSPIRE_SHM_SIZE` (or `job.shm_size` in config.toml) sets default shared memory (GiB) for job creation (`inspire job create`, `inspire run`) and notebook creation (`inspire notebook create`).
- Optional: `INSPIRE_BRIDGE_ACTION_TIMEOUT` (or `bridge.action_timeout` in config.toml) sets default timeout (seconds) for `inspire bridge exec`.
- Never commit credentials; prefer shell exports or local dotenv tooling. Use `inspire config check` to validate setup.

## Public Sync & Ignore Policy
- Treat `.gitignore` as the source of truth for non-public/internal artifacts.
- Paths currently treated as internal/ignored include `.inspire/`, `internal/`, `scripts/`, `API_ENDPOINTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `config.toml.example`, and `docs/rtunnel-ssh-setup.md`.
- When preparing `github-public` sync, avoid introducing dependencies on ignored paths in docs, examples, tests, or command instructions.
